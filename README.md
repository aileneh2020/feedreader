# FEEDREADER FOR FRONT-END NANODEGREE


## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Use of [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) version 2.1.2 to test a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail (red) and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass (green).


## SETUP

Download the [files](https://github.com/aileneh2020/feedreader.git) or clone with the following command `git clone https://github.com/aileneh2020/feedreader.git`.

Open the **index.html** file. Results of Jasmine testing will show immediately at the bottom of the screen since the test is written as an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). The specs can be found in **/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** file and additional tests may be added here as well.


## RESOURCES

Utilizes jQuery, Handlebars templating library and Google Feed Reader API.
