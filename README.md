# Project Overview

Use of [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


# How will I complete this project?

Project created by Udacity as part of the Front-End Nanodegree program. This is the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric).

Download or clone the [Starter Code](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

Open the index.html file.

21. Write a README file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application. If you have added additional tests (for Udacious Test Coverage),  provide documentation for what these future features are and what the tests are checking for.
